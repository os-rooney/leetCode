# Intuition
My first thought on how to solve this problem would be to convert the input integer to a string, and then check if the string is a palindrome.

To do this, we can use two pointers to traverse the string from both ends and check if the characters match. If they match, we continue to the next pair of characters. If they don't match, we can immediately return false, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

If we reach the end of the string without finding any mismatched characters, then the string is a palindrome and we can return true.

However, the problem statement mentions a follow-up question that asks us to solve the problem without converting the integer to a string. In that case, I would explore other approaches such as reversing the integer and comparing it with the original integer, as I mentioned in my previous answer.

# Approach
My approach to solving this problem would be to reverse the input integer and then compare it with the original integer. If the reversed integer is equal to the original integer, then the original integer is a palindrome.

To do this, we can use the modulo operator (%) to extract the last digit of the integer, and then divide the integer by 10 to remove the last digit. We can keep doing this until the integer becomes 0, and in the process, we can construct a new integer that contains the digits of the original integer in reverse order.

Here's the general algorithm:

1. Check if the input integer is negative. If it is, return false as negative integers can't be palindromes.

2. Initialize a new variable reversed to 0.

3. While the input integer is not equal to 0, extract the last digit using the modulo operator and add it to reversed multiplied by 10. Then, divide the input integer by 10 to remove the last digit.

4. After the loop, compare the reversed integer with the original input integer. If they are equal, return true. Otherwise, return false.

# Complexity
- Time complexity: O(log(x))

- Space complexity: O(1)

# Code
```java
class Solution {
    public boolean isPalindrome(int x) {
        // check if x is negative
        if (x < 0) {
            return false;
        }
        
        // reverse the digits of x
        int reverse = 0;
        int original = x;
        while (x > 0) {
            reverse = reverse * 10 + x % 10;
            x /= 10;
        }
        
        // compare the reversed integer with the original integer
        return reverse == original;
    }
}
```
